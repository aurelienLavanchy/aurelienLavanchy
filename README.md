# About me

I'm **Aur√©lien Lavanchy**, a junior developper fresh out of a Web Developper Bootcamp.
I'm looking to expand my skills by transitioning from *Javascript* to *Typrescript*, learn *PHP* and revisit *Python*.

## Portfolio

My portfolio contains the projects I've worked on during training (and eventually outside of it too), you can find it [here](https://aurelienlavanchy.github.io/Portfolio).
